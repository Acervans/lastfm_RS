# LastFM RecSys with Sentiment Analysis

The goal of this project is to build a Recommender System using the Last.FM API and sentiment analysis tools, using the **NRC-VAD Lexicon** (NRC Valence, Arousal, and Dominance Lexicon).
It consists of hybrid recommendation techniques (collaborative filtering and content-based) and sentiment analysis applied to recommendation.
