In our School a considerable number of documents are produced, as many aducational as research. Our students also contribute to this production
through his final degree, master and thesis projects. The objective of this material is to facilitate the editing of all these documents and at the same time to promote our corporate image, facilitating the visibility and recognition of our center.

In this sense we have tried to design a style of \LaTeXe\ that maintains a corporate image and with simple commands that allow to maintain the corporate image with the necessary quality without forgetting the needs of the author. For this, a set of simple commands have been created around complex packages. These commands allow you to perform most of the operations that a document of this type may need.

Likewise, you can control a little the design of the document through the options of the style but always maintaining the institutional image.
