    \item The database will store a table for each main entity of the dataset: users, tracks, artists, albums and tags; with their respective identifiers and names.
    \item The database will store multiple tracks, top artists and top albums associated with one or more users, establishing many-to-many relationships stored in independent tables.
    \begin{functionalmod}[DB]
        \item Each track must have an associated artist, corresponding to a one-to-many relationship between artists and tracks.
        \item Each track could belong to an album, establishing a one-to-many relationship between albums and tracks. 
        \item Each album must have an artist, establishing a one-to-many relationship between artists and albums.
    \end{functionalmod}
    \item The database will store tags associated with tracks, artists and albums, requiring separate tables and appropriate references to store these many-to-many relationships.
